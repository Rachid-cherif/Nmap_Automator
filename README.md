# nmap_automator
nmap automator in android studio 

The main goal for this application is to automate some of the commands nmap, and test it and save the result (history).

This will ensure three things:
1/ Enter an ip address and choose the command to scan.
2/ Save the command, result and time (using SQLite Database).
3/ manage the result(delete unwanted result).
